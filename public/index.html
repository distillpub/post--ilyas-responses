                Bugs, They Are
                Features</em></h1>
        <p>Ilya et al.'s paper was received with much interest by the research community.
            In an experimental attempt to advance the scientific
            dialogue,
            Distill is publishing a collection of commentary articles and clarifications developed in collaboration with
            the original paper's authors. </p>

    <d-article>

        <p>
            On May 6th, Andrew Ilyas and colleagues <a href="http://gradientscience.org/adv/">published a paper</a>
            <d-cite key="ilyas2019adversarial"></d-cite> outlining two sets of experiments.
            Firstly, they showed that models trained on adversarial examples can transfer to real data,
            and secondly that models trained on a dataset derived from the representations of robust neural networks
            seem to inherit non-trivial robustness.
            They proposed an intriguing interpretation for their results:
            adversarial examples are due to "non-robust features" which are highly predictive but imperceptible to
            humans.
        </p>

        <p>
            The paper was received with intense interest and discussion
            on social media, mailing lists, and reading groups around the world.
            How should we interpret these experiments?
            Would they replicate?<d-footnote>
                Advarserial example research is particularly vulnerable to a certain kind of non-replication among
                disciplines of machine learning,
                because it requires researchers to play both attack and defense.
                It's easy for even very rigorous researchers to accidentally use a weak attack.
                However, as we'll see, Ilyas et al's results have held up to initial scrutiny.
            </d-footnote>
            And if non-robust feature exist... what are they?
        </p>

        <p>
            To explore these questions, Distill decided to run an experimental "discussion article."<d-footnote>
                Running a discussion article is something Distill has wanted to try for several years.
                It was originally suggested to us by Ferenc Huszar, who writes many lovely discussions of papers on <a
                    href="https://www.inference.vc/">his blog</a>.
                <br><br>
                Why not just have everyone write private blog posts like Ferenc?
                Distill hopes that providing a more organized forum for many people to participate
                can give more researchers license to invest energy in discussing other's work
                and make sure there's an opportunity for all parties to comment and respond before the final version is
                published.
            </d-footnote>
            We invited a number of researchers
            to write comments on the paper and organized discussion and responses from the original authors.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Machine Learning community
            <a href="https://www.machinelearningdebates.com/program">sometimes</a>
            <a
                href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/cvpr-paper-controversy-ml-community-reviews-peer-review-79bf49eb0547">worries</a>
            that peer review isn't thorough enough.
            In contrast to this, we were struck by how deeply respondents engaged.
            Some respondents literally invested weeks in replicating results, running new experiments, and thinking
            deeply about the original paper.
            We also saw respondents update their views on non-robust features as they ran experiments — sometimes back
            and forth!
            The original authors similarly deeply engaged in discussing their results, clarifying misunderstandings, and
            even running new experiments in response to comments.
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion Themes</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Clarifications</b>:
            Discussion between the respondents and original authors was able
            to surface several misunderstandings or opportunities to sharpen claims.
            The original authors summarize this in their rebuttal.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Successful Replication</b>:
            Respondents successfully reproduced many of the experiments in Ilyas et al <d-cite
                key="ilyas2019adversarial"></d-cite> and had no unsuccessful replication attempts.
            This was significantly facilitated by the release of code, models, and datasets by the original authors.
            Gabriel Goh and Preetum Nakkiran both independently reimplemented and replicated
            the non-robust dataset experiments.<d-footnote>
                Preetum reproduced the $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{det}$ non-robust dataset experiment as described in the
                paper, for $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ attacks.
                <br>
                Gabriel repproduced both $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{det}$ and $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{rand}$ for $L_2$
                attacks.
            </d-footnote>
            Preetum also replicated part of the robust dataset experiment by
            training models on the provided robust dataset and finding that they seemed non-trivially robust.
            It seems epistemically notable that both Preetum and Gabriel were initially skeptical.
            Preetum emphasizes that he found it easy to make the phenomenon work and that it was robust to many variants
            and hyperparmeters he tried.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Exploring the Boundaries of Non-Robust Transfer</b>:
            Three of the comments focused on variants of the "non-robust dataset" experiment,
            where training on adversarial examples transfers to real data.
            When, how, and why does it happen?
            Gabriel Goh explores an alternative mechanisms for the results,
            Preetum Nakkiran shows a special construction where it doesn't happen,
            and Eric Wallace shows that transfer can happen for other kinds of incorrectly labeld data.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Properties of Robust and Non-Robust Features</b>:
            The other three comments focused on the properties of robust and non-robust models.
            Gabriel Goh explores what non-robust features might look like in the case of linear models,
            while Dan Hendrycks and Justin Gilmer discuss the role of high-frequency noise in adversarial examples,
            and Reiichiro Nakano explores the qualitative differences of robust models in the context of style transfer.

                    "Note that since our experiments work across architectures,
                    “distillation” in weight space does not occur. The only distillation that can
                    arise is “feature space” distillation, which is actually exactly our hypothesis.
                    In particular, feature-space distillation would not work in <a href="rebuttal/#world1"> World
                        1</a>—if the adversarial examples we generated did not exploit useful features, we should
                    not have been able to “distill” a useful model from them. (In fact, one might think
                    of normal model training as just “feature distillation” of the humans that
                    labeled the dataset.) Furthermore, the hypothesis that all we need is enough
                    model-consistent points in order to recover a model, seems to be disproven by
                    Preetum's <a href="#response-5"> “bugs-only dataset”</a>
                    and other (e.g. <d-cite key="milli2018model"></d-cite>) settings."

        <h3>Citation Information</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to cite the author clarifications or rebuttals, please cite <a href="rebuttal/#citation">their
                linked rebuttal</a> directly. If you'd like to cite a
            response, you'll find citation information at the bottom of each individual response, after the author
            rebuttals. This article should only be cited if you're explicitly referring to the editorial explanation of
            this format.
        </p>

        <h3>Editorial Note</h3>
        <p>
            This discussion article is an experiment organized by Chris Olah and Ludwig Schubert. Chris Olah initiated,
            organized and acted as editor for the response and rebuttal process. Ludwig Schubert
            assisted by assembling the responses into their current presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            We're extremely grateful for the time
            and effort that both the authors of the responses as well as the authors of the original paper put into this
            process, and the patience they had with the editorial team as we experimented with this format.
            Respondents were selected in two ways.
            Some respondents came to our attention because they were actively working on better understanding the Ilyas
            et al results.
            Other respondents were subject matter experts we reached out to.
        </p>


        <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
        <p>
            Distill is grateful to all respondents and the original authors for their generous engagement in this
            experiment.
            Distill is also grateful to Ferenc Huszar for encouraging us to explore this style of article.
        </p>
