        <h1>Responses to<em>"Adversarial Examples Are Not
                Bugs, They Are
                Features"</em></h1>
        <p>Ilya et al.'s paper was received with much interest. In an experimental attempt to advance the scientific
            dialogue,
            Distill is publishing a collection of commentary articles and clarifications developed in collaboration with
            the original paper's authors. </p>

        <p>Hopefully Chris can write about what this all means eloquently here.</p>
