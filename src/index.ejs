        <h1>A Discussion of <em>"Adversarial Examples Are Not
                Bugs, They Are
                Features"</em></h1>
        <p>Ilya et al.'s paper was received with much interest.
          In an experimental attempt to advance the scientific
            dialogue,
            Distill is publishing a collection of commentary articles and clarifications developed in collaboration with
            the original paper's authors. </p>
    </d-title>

    <d-article>

        <p>
          On May 6th, Andrew Ilyas and colleagues <a>published a paper</a> <d-cite key=""></d-cite> outlining two sets of experiments.
          Firstly, they showed that models trained on advarserial examples can transfer to real data,
          and secondly that models trained on a dataset derived from the representations of robust neural networks seem to inherit non-trivial robustness.
          They proposed an intruiging interpretation for their results:
          advarserial examples are due to "non-robust features" which are highly predictive but impercetible to humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          The paper was received with intense interest and discussion
          on social media, mailing lists, and reading groups around the world.
          How should we intepret these experiments?
          Would they replicate?<d-footnote>
            Advarserial example research is particularly vulnerable to a certain kind of non-replication among disciplines of machine learning,
            because it requires researchers to play both attack and defense.
            It's easy for even very rigorous researchers to accidentally use a weak attack.
            However, as we'll see, Ilyas et al's results have held up to initial scrutiny.
          </d-footnote>
          And if non-rbobust feature exist... what are they?
        </p>

        <p>
          To explore these questions, Distill decided to run an experimental "discussion article."
          We invited a number of researchers
          to write comments on the paper and organized discussion and responses from the original authors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Machine Learning community
          <a href="https://www.machinelearningdebates.com/program">sometimes</a>
          <a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/cvpr-paper-controversy-ml-community-reviews-peer-review-79bf49eb0547">worries</a>
          about having a weak culture of peer reivew.
          In contrast to this, we were struck by how deeply respondants engaged.
          Some respondants literally invested weeks in replicating results, running new experiments, and thinking deeply about the original paper.
          We also saw respondants update their views on non-rboust features as they ran experiments -- sometimes back and forth!
          The original authors similarly deeply engaged in discussing their results, clarifying misunderstandings, and even running new experiments in response to comments.
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion Themes</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Clarifications</b>:
          Discussion between the respondants and original authors was able
          to surface several misunderstandings or opportunities to sharpen claims.
          The original authors summarize this in their rebuttal.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Successful Replication</b>:
          Respondants succesfully reproduced many of the experiments in Ilyas et al <d-cite key=""></d-cite> and had no unsucessful replication attempts.
          This was significantly facilitated by the release of code, models, and datasets by the original authors.
          Gabriel Goh and Preetum Nakkiran both independently reimplemented and replicated
          the non-robust dataset experiments.<d-footnote>
            Preetum reproduced the D_{det} non-robust dataset experiment as described in the paper, for L_infinity and L_2 attacks.
            Gabriel repproduced both D_{det} and D_{rand}.
          </d-footnote>
          Preetum also also replicated part of the robust dataset experiment by
          training models on the provided robust dataset and finding that they seemed non-trivially robust.
          It seems epistemically notable that both Preetum and Gabriel were initially skeptical.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Exploring the Boundaries of Non-Robust Transfer</b>:
          Three of the comments focused explored variants of the "non-robust dataset" experiment,
          where training on advarserial examples transfers to real data.
          When, how, and why does it happen?
          Gabriel Goh and Eric Wallace explore two alternative mechanisms or hypotheses for the results,
          while Preetum Nakkiran shows a special construction where it doesn't happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Properties of Robust and Non-Robust Features</b>:
          The other three comments focused on the properties of robust and non-robust models.
          Gabriel Goh explores what non-robust features might look like in the case of linear models,
          while Dan Hendrycks and Justin Gilmer discuss the role of high-frequency noise in advarserial examples,
          and Reiichiro Nakano explores the qualitative differences of robust models in the context of style transfer.

                    The construction of explicit non-robust features is
                    very interesting and makes progress towards the challenge of visualizing some of
                    the useful non-robust features detected by our experiments. We also agree that
                    non-robust features arising as “distractors” is indeed not precluded by our
                    theoretical framework, even if it is precluded by our experiments. Though for
                    our purposes this simple theoretical framework sufficed for reasoning about
                    experiments<d-footnote>We also presented a theoretical setting where we can
                        analyze things fully rigorously in Section 4 of our paper.</d-footnote>, this comment
                    identifies finding a more comprehensive definition of feature as an interesting
                    future research direction.

                    This
                    is a valid concern that was actually one of our motivations for creating the
                    $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{det}$ dataset—which, as the comment notes, actually
                    has <em>misleading</em> robust features. The corresponding experiment further
                    improves our understanding of the underlying phenomenon.

                    The demonstration of models that learn from high-frequency components of the data is interesting and
                    nicely aligns with our findings. Now, even though susceptibility to noise could indeed arise from
                    non-robust useful features, this kind of brittleness (akin to adversarial examples)
                    of ML models has been so far predominantly viewed as a consequence of model
                    “bugs” that will be eliminated by “better” models. Finally, we agree that our
                    models need to be robust to a much broader set of perturbations&mdash;expanding the
                    set of relevant perturbations will help identify even more non-robust features
                    and further distill the useful features we actually want our models to rely on.

                    Very interesting results, highlighting the effect of non-robust features and the utility of

                    robustly trained models will have in neural network art! We were also really
                    intrigued by the mysteriousness of VGG with style transfer. As such, we took a
                    deeper dive which found some interesting links between robustness and style
                    transfer that suggest that perhaps robustness does indeed have a role.

                    We note that as discussed in

                    examples that are “features” is sufficient to corroborate our main thesis. This comment
                    illustrates, however, that we can indeed craft adversarial examples that are
                    based on “bugs” in realistic settings. Interestingly, such examples don’t
                    transfer, which provides further support for the link between transferability
                    and non-robust features.

                    Note that since our experiments work across architectures,
                    “distillation” in weight space does not occur. The only distillation that can
                    arise is “feature space” distillation, which is actually exactly our hypothesis.
                    In particular, feature-space distillation would not work in <a href="rebuttal/#world1"> World
                        1</a>—if the adversarial examples we generated did not exploit useful features, we should
                    not have been able to “distill” a useful model from them. (In fact, one might think
                    of normal model training as just “feature distillation” of the humans that
                    labeled the dataset.) Furthermore, the hypothesis that all we need is enough
                    model-consistent points in order to recover a model, seems to be disproven by
                    Preetum's <a href="#response-5"> “bugs-only dataset”</a>
                    and other (e.g. <d-cite key="milli2018model"></d-cite>) settings.
